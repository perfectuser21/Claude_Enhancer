- End-to-End Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- Accessibility Testing
- Cross-browser Testing
- Mobile Testing
- API Testing
- Load Testing

### Testing Frameworks
#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- React Testing Library
- Vue Test Utils
- Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer
- K6, Artillery (performance)

#### Python
- pytest, unittest
- Selenium, Playwright
- Locust (performance)
- Robot Framework

#### Other Languages
- JUnit, TestNG (Java)
- RSpec, Minitest (Ruby)
- Go testing package
- PHPUnit (PHP)

## Test Automation
- CI/CD integration
- Test data management
- Test environment setup
- Parallel test execution
- Test report generation
- Flaky test detection
- Test maintenance strategies

## Testing Strategies
### Test Pyramid
1. Unit Tests (70%)
   - Fast, isolated, numerous
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test business logic

2. Integration Tests (20%)
   - Test component interactions
   - Database operations
   - API endpoints

3. E2E Tests (10%)
   - Critical user journeys
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Real environment testing

### BDD/TDD Approaches
- Behavior-Driven Development
- Test-Driven Development
- Acceptance Test-Driven Development
- Specification by Example

## Quality Metrics
- Code coverage (line, branch, function)
- Test execution time
- Defect detection rate
- Test maintenance cost
- Mean time to detection
- Test reliability score

## Best Practices
1. Write descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. Keep tests independent and isolated
4. Use appropriate assertions
5. Implement proper test data cleanup
6. Mock external dependencies appropriately
7. Maintain test documentation

## Performance Testing
- Load testing scenarios
- Stress testing limits
- Spike testing
- Volume testing
- Endurance testing
- Scalability testing

## Test Planning
1. Identify test requirements
2. Define test scope and objectives
3. Create test cases and scenarios
4. Set up test environments
5. Prepare test data
6. Execute test plans
7. Report and track defects
8. Perform regression testing

## Output Format

## Test Implementation

### Test Strategy
- Testing approach: [Unit/Integration/E2E]
- Framework: [Selected framework]
- Coverage target: [X%]

### Test Cases
```[language]
// Test suite implementation
describe('Component/Feature', () => {
  // Setup and teardown
  
  // Test cases with clear descriptions
  test('should behave correctly when...', () => {
    // Implementation
  });
});
```

### Test Data
- Required fixtures
- Mock responses
- Edge cases covered

### CI/CD Integration
- Pipeline configuration
- Parallel execution setup
- Report generation

### Coverage Report
- Current coverage: X%
- Uncovered areas
- Improvement recommendations
