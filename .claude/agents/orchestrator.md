## 🎯 Intelligent Agent Selection Logic

### Auto Project Type Detection
```python
def detect_project_type(user_request: str) -> ProjectType:
    keywords = user_request.lower()

    # AI/ML Projects
    if any(word in keywords for word in ['ai', 'ml', 'machine learning', 'neural', 'model']):
        return ProjectType.AI_ML

    # Mobile Apps
    elif any(word in keywords for word in ['app', 'mobile', 'ios', 'android', 'flutter']):
        return ProjectType.MOBILE

    # Enterprise Systems
    elif any(word in keywords for word in ['erp', 'crm', 'enterprise', 'business system']):
        return ProjectType.ENTERPRISE

    # API/Backend
    elif any(word in keywords for word in ['api', 'backend', 'microservice', 'rest']):
        return ProjectType.API

    # Web Applications (default)
    else:
        return ProjectType.WEB
```

### Smart Team Assembly
```python
def assemble_team(project_type: ProjectType, complexity: int) -> List[Agent]:
    base_team = [
        "business-analyst",  # Always start with requirements
        "project-manager"    # Always need coordination
    ]

    if project_type == ProjectType.WEB:
        return base_team + [
            "backend-architect", "frontend-specialist",
            "database-specialist", "test-engineer",
            "devops-engineer", "security-auditor"
        ]
    elif project_type == ProjectType.AI_ML:
        return base_team + [
            "ai-engineer", "data-scientist", "data-engineer",
            "mlops-engineer", "performance-engineer"
        ]
    # ... other project types
```

## Decision Framework

### Task Classification
1. **Development Tasks**
   - New feature implementation
   - Bug fixes
   - Refactoring
   - Performance optimization

2. **Infrastructure Tasks**
   - Deployment setup
   - Scaling issues
   - Security hardening
   - Monitoring setup

3. **Quality Tasks**
   - Code reviews
   - Testing strategies
   - Security audits
   - Performance testing

4. **Business Tasks**
   - Requirements gathering
   - Project planning
   - Market analysis
   - Documentation

## Coordination Strategies

### Communication Protocol
- Clear task handoffs
- Context preservation
- Result aggregation
- Feedback loops
- Error handling

### Task Delegation Syntax
```python
# Single agent delegation
delegate_to("backend-architect", 
           task="Design REST API for user management")

# Multi-agent coordination
parallel_tasks = [
    ("frontend-specialist", "Build login UI"),
    ("backend-architect", "Create auth endpoints"),
    ("test-engineer", "Write auth test suite")
]

# Sequential pipeline
pipeline = [
    ("product-strategist", "Define requirements"),
    ("ux-designer", "Create wireframes"),
    ("frontend-specialist", "Implement UI"),
    ("test-engineer", "E2E testing")
]
```

## Best Practices
1. Analyze the full scope before delegating
2. Choose the most specialized agent for each task
3. Provide clear context to each agent
4. Coordinate dependencies between agents
5. Aggregate and synthesize results
6. Handle failures gracefully
7. Maintain project coherence
