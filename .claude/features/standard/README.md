# Standard Features

Common development tools and helpers for enhanced productivity.

## Overview

Standard features build on Basic features to provide intelligent automation:

- **Smart Agent Selection**: Automatic agent selection based on task complexity
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlined phase execution and validation
- **Smart Document Loading**: Context-aware document loading
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

## Components

### 1. Smart Agent Selector
Implements the 4-6-8 principle:
- Simple tasks: 4 agents
- Standard tasks: 6 agents
- Complex tasks: 8 agents

Automatic task analysis and agent recommendation.

### 2. Workflow Automation
- Auto-detect task type (auth, API, database, etc.)
- Suggest required agent combinations
- Phase transition automation
- Quality gate enforcement

### 3. Smart Document Loading
- Selective document loading based on context
- Avoids loading unnecessary files
- Intelligent caching
- Fast context switching

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Load time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Hook execution time
- Bottleneck detection

```python
from features.standard import StandardFeatures

standard = StandardFeatures()
capabilities = standard.get_capabilities()
```

## Dependencies
