# Advanced Features (Experimental)

Optional enhancements and experimental features for power users.

## Overview

Advanced features provide cutting-edge capabilities that are still in development:

- **Self-Healing System**: Automatic health monitoring and repair
- **Memory Compression**: Intelligent archiving and compression
- **Semantic Diff**: AI-powered code difference analysis
- **Auto-Optimization**: Automatic performance suggestions

## Warning

⚠️ **Experimental Features**: These features are under active development and may:
- Change without notice
- Have performance impacts
- Contain bugs or unexpected behavior
- Not be fully documented

**Recommendation**: Only enable if you're comfortable with experimental features.

## Components

### 1. Self-Healing System
- Daily health checks
- Automatic issue detection
- Self-repair capabilities
- Evidence generation

### 2. Memory Compression
- Archive old decision logs
- Compress historical data
- Semantic compression
- Smart retention policies

### 3. Semantic Diff
- AI-powered code analysis
- Intent-aware differences
- Refactoring detection
- Impact assessment

### 4. Auto-Optimization
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Automatic optimization suggestions
- Memory usage optimization
- Load time improvements

## Enabling Advanced Features

To enable advanced features, edit `.claude/features/config.yaml`:

```yaml
features:
  advanced:
    enabled: true  # Change to true
```

Or enable individual features:

```yaml
features:
  advanced:
    enabled: true
    features:
      self_healing:
        enabled: true  # Enable only self-healing
```

## Usage

```python
from features.advanced import AdvancedFeatures

advanced = AdvancedFeatures()
if advanced.enabled:
    capabilities = advanced.get_capabilities()
```

## Dependencies

- Basic features (required)
- Standard features (required)

## Performance

- Load time: <80ms (slower due to experimental nature)
- Memory usage: <50MB
- May require additional dependencies

## Roadmap

- [ ] Stabilize self-healing system
- [ ] Optimize memory compression
- [ ] Improve semantic diff accuracy
- [ ] Graduate stable features to Standard tier
