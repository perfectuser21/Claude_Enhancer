Create a new git worktree for parallel development. This allows you to work on multiple features simultaneously without switching branches.

Please specify:
1. Feature name (will create ../Claude Enhancer-{feature})
2. Branch name (feature/{name})
3. Whether to open in new VSCode window

Example: Create worktree for authentication feature in ../Claude Enhancer-auth on branch feature/authentication
