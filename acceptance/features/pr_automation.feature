    Given I have a feature branch "feature/P3-t1-user-auth"
    And all quality gates passed
    When I run "ce publish"
    Then a PR should be created with title matching the branch
    And the PR description should include quality metrics
    And the PR should be in draft mode
    And I should see the PR URL
    And the PR should be linked to the branch

  @pr @metadata
  Scenario: PR includes comprehensive metadata
    Given I completed feature "payment-integration"

    And CI checks should still run
    And the PR should not request reviewers yet
    And I should see "Draft PR created successfully"

  @pr @ready-mode

    And team should be notified
    And the PR should move out of draft state
