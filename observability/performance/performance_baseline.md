## 🎓 Performance Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Simple = Fast**: Bash string manipulation outperforms external tools
2. **Early Exit**: Bypass mode and whitelist short-circuit saves 90% latency
3. **File-Based State**: No database overhead for simple operations
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: openssl/sqlite3 performance is excellent

### Challenges

1. **File I/O Bottleneck**: Rate limiter could benefit from caching
2. **Sleep in Tests**: Inflates test suite execution time (unavoidable)
3. **Dependency Checks**: Slowest part of health check (unavoidable)

### Best Practices Discovered

1. **Benchmark Early**: Established baseline in P4, not P7
2. **Set Realistic Targets**: All targets achievable without optimization
3. **Document Overhead**: Track which operations add latency
4. **Trade-offs Visible**: Security > Performance (acceptable trade-off)
