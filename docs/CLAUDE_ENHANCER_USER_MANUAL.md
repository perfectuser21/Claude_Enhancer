## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Claude isn't using enough specialists"
**Problem:** You see a message about minimum agent requirements.

**Solution:** This is Claude Enhancer's quality control working correctly!
- Don't worry - this ensures professional-grade results
- Allow the system to use the recommended number of specialists
- Each agent contributes unique expertise to your project

#### "The project seems complex for my simple idea"
**Problem:** You wanted something simple but got enterprise-grade architecture.

**Solution:** This is intentional!
- Claude Enhancer builds for the future, not just today
- Your "simple" idea gets professional foundations
- This prevents costly rebuilds as you grow
- You can request a "minimal viable product" version

#### "I don't understand the technical details"
**Problem:** The explanations seem too technical.

**Solution:** Just ask for simpler explanations!
- Say: "Explain this like I'm five"
- Request: "Use analogies and simple language"
- Ask: "What does this mean for my business?"

#### "Changes are taking too long"
**Problem:** Modifications seem slower than initial creation.

**Explanation:**
- Initial creation uses parallel processing (multiple agents working simultaneously)
- Changes often require sequential updates (one thing affects another)
- Quality checks take time but prevent issues later

#### "Too many questions before starting"
**Problem:** Claude asks many clarifying questions.

**Solution:** This prevents costly mistakes!
- Answer the questions - they save time later
- Each question prevents a potential rebuild
- Better to clarify once than fix multiple times
