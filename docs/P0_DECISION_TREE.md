### Quick Self-Check

```
Am I stuck? Use this diagnostic:

Can't define problem?
  ‚Üí Read user requirements again
  ‚Üí Interview stakeholders

Can't design spikes?
  ‚Üí Ask: "What's the biggest unknown?"
  ‚Üí Start with simplest validation

Spikes failing?
  ‚Üí Is the approach fundamentally wrong?
  ‚Üí Try alternative technical solution

Can't assess risks?
  ‚Üí Use RICE framework
  ‚Üí Review similar past projects

Can't decide GO/NO-GO?
  ‚Üí Calculate evaluation matrix
  ‚Üí If score < 3.0, likely NO-GO
  ‚Üí If score ‚â• 4.0, likely GO
  ‚Üí If 3.0-3.9, review risks again

## üìã Quick Reference Checklist

Use this at each decision point:

### Before Starting P0
- [ ] Task is a coding task (not just discussion)
- [ ] Clear problem statement available
- [ ] Access to testing environment
- [ ] Time budget allocated (1-6 hours)

### During Technical Spikes
- [ ] Each spike tests one specific thing
- [ ] Commands are executable
- [ ] Results are documented
- [ ] Failures are explained

### During Risk Assessment

## üÜò Decision Tree Troubleshooting

### "I can't decide how many spikes"
‚Üí Follow this tree: Simple (2-3) ‚Üí Standard (3-5) ‚Üí Complex (5-7)

### "Spikes contradict each other"
‚Üí Re-examine assumptions. May need NEEDS-DECISION.

### "All spikes pass but it feels risky"
‚Üí Check risk assessment. May have missed a risk category.

### "Evaluation score is borderline (3.0)"
‚Üí Run 1-2 more spikes to increase confidence.

### "User won't decide (NEEDS-DECISION)"
‚Üí Provide clearer pros/cons. Add recommendation.
