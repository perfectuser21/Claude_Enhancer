# üîß Claude Enhancer Troubleshooting Guide
> Quick solutions to common issues and optimization tips

## üö® Emergency Troubleshooting

### "Hook is blocking my execution"
**Problem:** You see error messages about agent requirements or quality standards.

**‚úÖ This is GOOD** - Quality control is working!

**Solution:**
1. **Don't try to bypass** - This ensures professional results
2. **Understand the requirement** - Each agent brings unique expertise
3. **Allow the recommended agents** - They work in parallel for speed
4. **Trust the process** - More agents = better quality

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Error: "Need 5 agents for authentication system, only using 2"
‚úÖ Response: "I understand. Please use the full 5-agent team for enterprise-grade security."
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Too Many Questions Before Starting"

**Problem:** Claude asks many clarifying questions instead of starting immediately.

**Why This Happens:**
- Prevents costly mistakes and rebuilds
- Ensures the solution fits your actual needs
- Saves time in the long run

**Solution:**
- **Answer the questions** - They're investments in your success
- **Be patient** - 5 minutes of questions saves hours of fixes
- **Provide context upfront** to minimize questions

**Pro Tip:** Include details in your initial request:
```
‚ùå "Build me a website"
‚úÖ "Build a portfolio website for my photography business, targeting wedding clients, mobile-friendly, with booking system"
```

### 2. "Project Seems Too Complex"

**Problem:** You wanted something "simple" but got enterprise architecture.

**Why This Happens:**
- Claude Enhancer builds for the future, not just today
- Professional foundations prevent costly rebuilds
- "Simple" often means "easy to use," not "basic architecture"

**Solution:**
- **Embrace the quality** - You're getting professional-grade code
- **Request MVP version** if needed: "Start with minimal viable product"
- **Ask for phased approach**: "Build basic version first, then enhance"

### 3. "Don't Understand Technical Details"

**Problem:** Explanations seem too technical or overwhelming.

**Quick Fixes:**
```
Say: "Explain this like I'm five"
Say: "Use simple analogies"
Say: "What does this mean for my business?"
Say: "Skip technical details, just tell me what it does"
```

**Example:**
```
‚ùå Technical: "Implementing OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for stateless authentication"
‚úÖ Simple: "Adding a secure login system like banks use"
```

### 4. "Agents Not Working in Parallel"

**Problem:** You notice agents being called sequentially instead of simultaneously.

**Why This Happens:**
- Some tasks have dependencies (one must finish before another starts)
- Quality gates require sequential validation
- Complex modifications need ordered execution

**When to Worry:**
- Only worry if simple, independent tasks run sequentially
- For complex projects, some sequential work is normal

**Solution:**
- Ask: "Can any of these tasks run in parallel?"
- Request: "Identify independent tasks for parallel execution"

### 5. "Changes Taking Longer Than Expected"

**Problem:** Initial creation was fast, but modifications seem slow.

**Why This Happens:**
- Initial creation uses parallel processing (multiple agents working simultaneously)
- Changes often require careful integration with existing code
- Quality checks ensure changes don't break existing functionality

**Solutions:**
- **Plan changes in batches** - Multiple related changes together
- **Be specific about scope** - Minimize unexpected impacts
- **Request impact assessment** first if unsure

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Speed Up Your Requests

#### 1. Front-load Information
**Instead of this conversation:**
```
You: "Build me an app"
Claude: "What kind of app?"
You: "For fitness"
Claude: "What features?"
You: "Track workouts and nutrition"
Claude: "What platforms?"
You: "iOS and Android"
```

**Do this:**
```
You: "Build a fitness app for iOS and Android that tracks workouts and nutrition, targeting casual fitness enthusiasts, with offline sync and social sharing"
```

#### 2. Specify Your Priorities
```
"Build an e-commerce site prioritizing:
1. Fast checkout process
2. Mobile experience
3. SEO optimization
4. Inventory management"
```

#### 3. Mention Your Constraints
```
"Create a blog with these constraints:
- Budget: Under $50/month hosting
- Timeline: Launch in 2 weeks
- Maintenance: Minimal technical upkeep
- Growth: Handle 1000 daily visitors"
```

### Optimize Agent Selection

#### Let Quality Standards Work
```
‚ùå "Just use 2 agents, keep it simple"
‚úÖ "Use the recommended agent team for professional quality"
```

#### Trust the Process
```
‚ùå "Why do I need a security auditor for a simple blog?"
‚úÖ "I understand security is important even for simple projects"
```

## üîç Debugging Common Scenarios

### "My Website is Slow"

**Diagnostic Questions Claude Will Ask:**
- How slow? (specific metrics help)
- When did it start? (recent changes?)
- Which pages? (all or specific?)
- What device/browser? (mobile vs desktop?)

**What Gets Deployed:**
- Performance Engineer (speed analysis)
- Database Specialist (query optimization)
- Frontend Specialist (loading optimization)
- DevOps Engineer (server optimization)

### "Users Can't Login"

**Diagnostic Process:**
- Security Auditor (check for breaches)
- Backend Architect (verify authentication flow)
- Database Specialist (check user data)
- Test Engineer (reproduce the issue)

### "Need to Add Feature to Existing Project"

**Integration Process:**
- Requirements Analyst (understand the feature)
- Backend Architect (assess current architecture)
- Test Engineer (ensure no breaking changes)
- Technical Writer (update documentation)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Issues

### "Tests Are Failing"

**Automated Response:**
1. Test Engineer diagnoses specific failures
2. Code Reviewer checks for integration issues
3. Performance Tester validates speed impacts
4. Security Auditor ensures no vulnerabilities

**Your Part:**
- Provide specific error messages
- Describe what you expected vs. what happened
- Mention if this worked before

### "Security Warnings"

**Never Ignore These:**
- Claude Enhancer includes security by default
- Warnings indicate real vulnerabilities
- Fixing early prevents major problems later

**Typical Security Deployments:**
- Security Auditor (vulnerability assessment)
