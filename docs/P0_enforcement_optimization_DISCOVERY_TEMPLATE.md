- **Be Concrete**: Use specific examples, not abstractions
- **Be Honest**: Call out unknowns and risks clearly
- **Be Actionable**: Every section should enable decisions

### Formatting Best Practices

- **Show, Don't Tell**: Include actual commands/output
- **Break Up Text**: Short paragraphs, bullet points

### Code and Command Examples
- Always use actual, executable commands
- Include expected output
- Show both success and failure cases
- Comment complex commands

### Tables and Matrices
- Use tables for comparisons and structured data
- Keep columns ‚â§ 6 for readability
- Include totals/summaries where appropriate

## üö® Common P0 Pitfalls to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: "Should Work" Syndrome
‚ùå **Bad**: "This approach should work because it's similar to..."
‚úÖ **Good**: "Spike validated this approach with the following test: [actual command and output]"

### Anti-Pattern 2: Vague Risk Assessment
‚ùå **Bad**: "There might be some performance issues"
‚úÖ **Good**: "TR-003: Query latency may increase by 15% (probability 40%, impact MEDIUM). Mitigation: Add caching layer."

### Anti-Pattern 3: Analysis Paralysis
‚ùå **Bad**: 50-page document with every possible consideration
‚úÖ **Good**: Focus on **critical** unknowns. P1 will handle details.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Missing Rollback Plans
‚ùå **Bad**: "If it fails, we'll figure it out"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Rollback: `git revert abc123 && ./scripts/restore_state.sh`"

### Anti-Pattern 5: Unquantified Benefits
‚ùå **Bad**: "This will improve user experience"
‚úÖ **Good**: "This reduces PR cycle time from 30min to 5min (83% improvement)"
