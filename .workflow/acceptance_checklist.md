# Acceptance Checklist - Workflow Enforcement System Fix

**Task**: Execute comprehensive fix for Claude Enhancer workflow enforcement system
**Branch**: feature/fix-workflow-enforcement
**Created**: 2025-10-19

## Phase 2 (Discovery) - Acceptance Criteria ✓

### Understanding Complete
- [x] Analyzed 2107 Phase references across 223 files
- [x] Identified 8 critical Claude Hooks requiring hardening
- [x] Identified 3 Git Hooks requiring verification

### Success Definition
**The system is "done" when:**
1. All Phase references use new naming (Phase 1-7)
2. Workflow validator has 95 steps (75 existing + 20 new)
3. All 8 Claude Hooks use exit 1 for critical violations
4. All 3 Git Hooks verified with exit 1 enforcement
5. CLAUDE.md fully synchronized with Phase 1-7
6. All automated tests pass
7. REVIEW.md documents all changes
