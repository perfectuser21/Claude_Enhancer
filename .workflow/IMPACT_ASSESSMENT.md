## 🎯 Assessment Scope

This assessment evaluates the **entire feature** (all phases), not just Phase 1 work.

**Feature**: Self-Enforcing Quality System
- Layer 1: CODEOWNERS (file protection)
- Layer 2: Sentinel CI (runtime validation in CI)
- Layer 3: Contract Tests (verify features work)
- Enhancement: phase_state_tracker.sh hook
- Enhancement: pre_merge_audit.sh runtime validation

## 📊 Impact Radius Calculation

### Risk Assessment: 8/10 (High)

**Risk Factors**:

🔴 **Modifying Core Workflow Enforcement** (Score: 10/10)
- Protected files include ALL hooks (.claude/hooks/**)
- Protected files include workflow system (.workflow/**)
- Changes affect how AI operates (phase_state_tracker.sh in PrePrompt)
- Potential to break existing workflow if CODEOWNERS misconfigured

🔴 **CI Pipeline Changes** (Score: 9/10)
- New CI workflow (guard-core.yml) with 61 checks
- If checks are too strict → block legitimate PRs
- If checks are too loose → miss actual hollow implementations
- CI runs on every push/PR → high visibility failures

🟡 **Modifying pre_merge_audit.sh** (Score: 7/10)
- Critical quality gate script
- Add new Check 7 with 4 sub-checks
- Risk of false positives (warning about stale state when actually fine)
- Risk of false negatives (missing actual hollow implementations)

🟢 **Low Risk Areas** (Score: 3/10)
- Contract tests are new, isolated (low risk)
- CODEOWNERS is declarative, limited blast radius
- phase_state_tracker.sh is informational only (doesn't block)

**Risk Score Breakdown**:
- Security impact: 7/10 (CODEOWNERS protects critical files)
- Data integrity: 5/10 (no data changes, but state tracking)
- System stability: 9/10 (affects core workflow enforcement)
- Reversibility: 7/10 (need to remove CODEOWNERS, revert CI, etc.)
- Blast radius: 9/10 (affects all future PRs)

**Final Risk**: 8/10

## 🎯 Impact Radius Formula

```
Radius = (Risk × 5) + (Complexity × 3) + (Scope × 2)
       = (8 × 5) + (7 × 3) + (8 × 2)
       = 40 + 21 + 16
       = 77/100
```

**Category**: 🔴 **Very High-Risk** (70-100分)

## 🤖 Agent Strategy Recommendation

### Recommended Agents: **6 agents**

**Threshold Analysis**:
- Very High Risk (≥70): 8 agents
- High Risk (50-69): 6 agents
- Medium Risk (30-49): 4 agents
- Low Risk (0-29): 0 agents

**Impact Radius = 77** → Falls into "Very High Risk" category → **8 agents recommended**

**However**, considering:
- Problem is well-defined (not exploratory)
- Solution architecture is clear (3 layers)
- Components are relatively independent
- We have clear test strategy

**Adjusted Recommendation: 6 agents** (one tier down from 8)

**Agent Allocation**:

   - Integration with existing CI
   - Estimated time: 2 hours

3. **Agent 3: Guard Scripts** (2 agents)
   - Agent 3a: check_critical_files.sh + check_critical_configs.sh
   - Agent 3b: check_sentinels.sh + validate_runtime_behavior.sh
   - Total: ~550 lines across 4 scripts
   - Estimated time: 3 hours (1.5 hours each)

4. **Agent 4: Contract Tests**
   - 4 contract test scripts (~290 lines total)
   - test_parallel_execution.sh
   - test_phase_management.sh
   - test_evidence_collection.sh

   - Estimated time: 2 hours

5. **Agent 5: Pre-merge Audit Enhancement**
   - Modify scripts/pre_merge_audit.sh
   - Add Check 7 with 4 sub-checks (~80 lines)
   - Ensure integration with existing checks
   - Estimated time: 1.5 hours

6. **Agent 6: Phase State Tracker & Integration Testing**
   - Create .claude/hooks/phase_state_tracker.sh (~80 lines)
   - Update .claude/settings.json
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify all components work together
   - Estimated time: 2 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 12 hours (with 6 agents working in parallel: ~2-3 hours wall time)

## 📈 Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas & Mitigation

#### Risk 1: CODEOWNERS Blocks Legitimate Changes
**Mitigation**:
- Start with protection of only most critical files (31 files, not more)
- Document override process in CLAUDE.md
- User (@perfectuser21) can quickly approve changes
- Can be modified/removed easily if too restrictive

#### Risk 2: CI Checks Too Strict (False Positives)
**Mitigation**:
- Runtime validation uses warnings, not hard fails (for stale state)
- Only critical issues cause hard fails (file missing, never executed)
- Graceful degradation in validate_runtime_behavior.sh
- 7-day staleness threshold (not too aggressive)

#### Risk 3: CI Checks Too Loose (False Negatives)
**Mitigation**:
- Sentinel strings detect file gutting
- Runtime validation checks actual execution logs
- Contract tests verify behavior, not just file existence
- Multiple layers provide redundancy

#### Risk 4: pre_merge_audit.sh Breaks
**Mitigation**:
- New Check 7 is additive, doesn't modify existing checks
- Uses existing log functions (log_pass, log_warn, log_fail)
- Thoroughly tested before merge
- Can be disabled by removing Check 7 section

#### Risk 5: phase_state_tracker.sh Spams AI
**Mitigation**:
- Hook is informational only (doesn't block)
- Output is concise (3-4 lines)
- Reminders only shown when relevant (phase complete)
- Can be disabled by removing from PrePrompt array

## 📝 Notes

### Why Very High-Risk (77/100)?

**Risk (8/10)**: Modifying core workflow enforcement is inherently risky. CODEOWNERS can block critical changes, CI can block legitimate PRs, pre_merge_audit.sh is a critical quality gate.

**Complexity (7/10)**: 6 components, ~1,500 lines, 20+ tests, CI integration. Not trivial.

**Scope (8/10)**: Affects all future PRs, runs on every push, protects 31 files, touches 5 modules.

**Result**: 77/100 = Very High-Risk

### Why 6 Agents (Not 8)?

**8 agents** is the formula recommendation for Very High-Risk (≥70).

**But**:
- Problem is well-defined (not exploratory)
- Solution architecture is clear (3 layers)
- Components are relatively independent
- We have clear test strategy
- Not a novel/experimental system

**Therefore**: 6 agents is sufficient (one tier down from 8).

**Assessment Status**: ✅ Complete
**Impact Radius**: 77/100 (Very High-Risk)
**Recommended Agents**: 6 agents
**Estimated Time**: 9-11 hours (AI time), 2-3 hours (wall time with parallelization)
**Ready for Phase 1.5**: Yes (proceed to PLAN.md)
