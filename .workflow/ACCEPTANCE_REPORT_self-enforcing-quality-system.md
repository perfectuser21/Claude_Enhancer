## Known Limitations

1. **Bypass Permissions**: Configuration verified but needs user testing to confirm no prompts
2. **Documentation TODOs**: 8 TODO/FIXME in documentation files (non-blocking, not in code)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Post-Merge)
1. Monitor PR #59 CI results (guard-core.yml will run)
2. Verify bypass permissions actually work (user feedback)
3. Test phase_state_tracker.sh in real workflow

### 30-Day Validation
1. Verify parallel execution actually happens in PRs
2. Monitor .phase/current maintenance
3. Track Hollow Implementation Rate (target: 0%)
4. Confirm no "said 10 times still wrong" issues
