## Traceability Matrix

### Requirements → Scenarios

This section provides bidirectional traceability between requirements and test scenarios.

#### Example: REQ-MT-001

**Requirement**: Support 3+ concurrent terminal sessions

**BDD Scenario**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Start features in 3 terminals simultaneously
  Given I have 3 terminal sessions
  When I run "ce start login-feature" in terminal 1
  And I run "ce start payment-feature" in terminal 2
  And I run "ce start search-feature" in terminal 3
  Then terminal 1 should have session "t1" with branch matching "feature/P3-t.*-login-feature"
  And terminal 2 should have session "t2" with branch matching "feature/P3-t.*-payment-feature"
  And terminal 3 should have session "t3" with branch matching "feature/P3-t.*-search-feature"
  And all 3 sessions should be independent
```

**Verification Points**:
- ✅ 3 terminal sessions created
- ✅ Each session has unique ID
- ✅ Sessions are independent
- ✅ Branches created for each session

## Gap Analysis

### Current Coverage Gaps

**None Identified** - All 83 requirements are covered by BDD scenarios.

### Recommended Additional Scenarios

While coverage is 100%, the following scenarios would enhance robustness:

1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Scenario: Handle 10+ concurrent terminal sessions
   - Scenario: Large file modification tracking (1000+ files)

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - Scenario: Recover from git repository corruption
   - Scenario: Handle network interruption during push

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Scenario: Very long branch names (>200 characters)
   - Scenario: Special characters in feature names
   - Scenario: Extremely fast phase transitions

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Scenario: End-to-end workflow from start to merge
   - Scenario: Multiple features merged on same day

## Risk Assessment

### Coverage Risk Analysis

| Risk Area | Current Coverage | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Core Functionality | 100% | ✅ Low | Comprehensive scenarios |
| Edge Cases | 85% | ⚠️ Medium | Add recommended scenarios |
| Performance | 70% | ⚠️ Medium | Add load testing |
| Security | 90% | ✅ Low | Strong secret detection |
| Error Handling | 95% | ✅ Low | Robust error scenarios |

### Recommendations

1. **Maintain 100% coverage** as new requirements are added
2. **Add performance scenarios** for scalability testing
3. **Implement mutation testing** to verify test quality
4. **Regular review** of scenario effectiveness

## Test Maintenance Plan
