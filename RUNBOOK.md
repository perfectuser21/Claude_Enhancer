# Claude Enhancer 5.0 Operations Runbook
> Complete Operations Guide | Emergency Procedures | Daily Operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### How to Begin a New Development Task
1. **Provide PRD to Claude Code**
   ```
   "我需要开发一个新功能：[详细描述功能需求]

   期望结果：[明确的成功标准]
   优先级：[High/Medium/Low]
   截止时间：[如有时间要求]"
   ```

2. **Claude Code Automatic Response**
   - 自动识别任务复杂度
   - 选择合适的Agent数量（4-6-8策略）
   - 启动8-Phase工作流（Phase 0-7）
   - 创建适当的分支结构

3. **System Auto-Progression**
   - 系统会自动推进到下一个Phase
   - 每个Phase完成后自动触发下一阶段
   - 无需手动干预，除非遇到错误

## ⚙️ Automatic Phase Progression Rules

### Phase Transition Logic
```mermaid
graph TD
    P0[Phase 0: Branch Creation] --> P1[Phase 1: Requirements]
    P1 --> P2[Phase 2: Design]
    P2 --> P3[Phase 3: Implementation]
    P3 --> P4[Phase 4: Local Testing]
    P4 --> P5[Phase 5: Code Commit]
    P5 --> P6[Phase 6: Code Review]
    P6 --> P7[Phase 7: Merge & Deploy]

    P1 -.->|Requirements Unclear| PAUSE[Human Input Required]
    P3 -.->|Implementation Blocked| PAUSE
    P4 -.->|Tests Failing| PAUSE
    P6 -.->|Review Changes Needed| PAUSE
```

### Auto-Progression Conditions
- **Phase 0 → Phase 1**: Branch created successfully
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Requirements documented and validated
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Design approved and architecture defined
- **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Code implementation complete
- **Phase 4 → Phase 5**: All tests passing
- **Phase 5 → Phase 6**: Code committed and hooks passed
- **Phase 6 → Phase 7**: Code review approved
- **Phase 7 → Complete**: Successfully merged and deployed

### Manual Intervention Triggers
System will **pause and request human input** when:
- Requirements are ambiguous or conflicting
- Technical blockers cannot be resolved automatically
- Test failures require business decision
- Security concerns need stakeholder approval
- Performance issues need optimization strategy

## 🔄 Failure Handling & Retry Logic

### 3-Strike Retry System
```
Attempt 1: Auto-retry with same approach
         ↓ (if fails)
Attempt 2: Auto-retry with alternative approach
         ↓ (if fails)
Attempt 3: Pause and request human assistance
```

### Retry Strategies by Phase

#### Phase 0 (Branch Creation)
- **Retry 1**: Clean branch name, remove special characters
- **Retry 2**: Force create branch with timestamp suffix
- **Pause**: Branch naming conflict needs human decision

#### Phase 1 (Requirements)
- **Retry 1**: Ask clarifying questions automatically
- **Retry 2**: Propose multiple requirement interpretations
- **Pause**: Requirements too vague for AI interpretation

#### Phase 2 (Design)
- **Retry 1**: Simplify design approach
- **Retry 2**: Alternative architecture pattern
- **Pause**: Design decision needs business input

#### Phase 3 (Implementation)
- **Retry 1**: Different Agent combination (4→6 or 6→8)
- **Retry 2**: Break down into smaller chunks
- **Pause**: Technical blocker requires research/decision

#### Phase 4 (Local Testing)
- **Retry 1**: Fix obvious test failures automatically
- **Retry 2**: Adjust test parameters or mocks
- **Pause**: Test failures indicate requirement misunderstanding

#### Phase 5 (Code Commit)
- **Retry 1**: Fix linting and formatting issues
- **Retry 2**: Resolve merge conflicts automatically
- **Pause**: Git conflicts require manual resolution

#### Phase 6 (Code Review)
- **Retry 1**: Address review comments automatically
- **Retry 2**: Refactor based on feedback
- **Pause**: Substantial changes requested

#### Phase 7 (Merge & Deploy)
- **Retry 1**: Retry deployment with fresh environment
- **Retry 2**: Rollback and re-deploy
- **Pause**: Infrastructure issues need investigation

```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### System Failure Response
1. **Immediate Assessment** (< 2 minutes)
   - Check current Phase status
   - Identify failure point
   - Assess impact scope

2. **Auto-Recovery Attempt** (2-5 minutes)
   - Execute automatic rollback if applicable
   - Restart failed services
   - Clear temporary files and caches

3. **Manual Intervention** (5+ minutes)
   - If auto-recovery fails
   - Escalate to human operator
   - Provide detailed failure context

### Critical Issues Escalation
- **P0 (Critical)**: System completely down → Immediate human notification
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature broken → 15-minute auto-recovery, then escalate
- **P2 (Medium)**: Performance degraded → 30-minute monitoring, then escalate
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor issues → Log for next maintenance window

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Deployment failure (any stage)
- Critical functionality broken
- Error rate > 50% increase
- Performance degraded > 2x baseline

# Rollback Execution
1. Identify last stable version
2. Revert main branch to stable commit
3. Re-deploy previous version
4. Validate rollback success
5. Create incident report
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Phase Stuck" Issues
**Symptoms**: Phase not progressing after expected time
**Solutions**:
1. Check `.phase/current` file status
2. Review last 10 log entries
3. Restart phase with `reset_phase` command
4. If persistent, escalate with full context

#### Agent Communication Failures
**Symptoms**: Agents not responding or incomplete responses
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Agent file integrity
2. Check system resource availability
3. Restart with reduced Agent count (8→6→4)
4. Clear Agent cache and retry

#### Git Operations Failing
**Symptoms**: Cannot create branches, commit, or push
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Git configuration
2. Check repository permissions
3. Clean working directory
4. Reset Git hooks if needed

#### Performance Degradation
**Symptoms**: Slower response times, high resource usage
**Solutions**:
1. Check current load and active processes
2. Clear temporary files and caches
3. Restart background services
4. Scale resources if needed

### Log Analysis Commands
